# Project breif
Developed an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for density and viscosity prediction in synthetic deep eutectic solvents, achieving state-of-the-art RÂ² scores of 99.23% (density) and 98.45% (viscosity).

Engineered a robust CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate model training and deployment, ensuring seamless integration and continuous delivery on AWS EC2.

Fine-tuned 10 advanced ML models, leveraging hyperparameter optimization to identify the most performant solution for predictive accuracy.
